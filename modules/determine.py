Warning : "Note that even for small len(x), the total number of permutations of x can quickly grow larger than the 
period of most random number generators. 
This implies that most permutations of a long sequence can never be generated. For example, a sequence of length 2080 is 
the largest that can fit within the period of the Mersenne Twister random number generator."
