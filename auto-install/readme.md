# Auto install script

Use one of:
- bis-install.sh : Tested on Ubuntu 18 LTS Only  
or
- bis-install-u20.sh: Test on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS only

- Needs login as root
- will reboot the vps after install

- Experimental, use at your own risks, may break you vps and need os reinstall

- But works for me :)
