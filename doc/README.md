# Note

This doc may be used for local dev, but is likely outdated.

To setup a Hypernode, refer to the up to date "one liner" installation instructions at https://github.com/bismuthfoundation/Bismuth-FAQ/blob/master/Hypernodes/00-Auto-Install-Script.md

See [Roadmap](Roadmap.md) for mid term devs.

# IMPORTANT

* I tend to cut the problems into small pieces, easier to handle. This may seem too much, and sometimes it is.  
  Once it's working, it's easier to see what are the real functional frontiers and how to refactor at best, rejoin modules or not.  
  In the mean time, it makes it easier to work in // on the project, since there are less collisions.
  
* Some things may be overcomplicated, and time will tell what can be simplified.

* Some things are tagged TODO: but can be left over for a Minimal Viable Product.

* FR: means Feature request. They are low prio TODO:
