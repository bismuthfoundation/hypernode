"""
This module hosts LedgerQueries, a class grouping all data extraction queries from the DB.
It is closely related to db handler, as it relies on the same db engine and structure.
This module only make use of a single DB handler, and suppose all data will be taken from that one.
In the context of wallet servers or hypernodes, this supposes full ledger, on disk.

The goal of this class is to provide optimized requests to be used by plugins,
so they don't have to deal with low level, and possibly changing, db structure.

Borrows code from Hypernodes, pow_interface

Still very alpha and not optimized.
