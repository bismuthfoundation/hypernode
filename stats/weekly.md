# Weekly data collection

To be automated.  
To be done only after Saturday, 08:00 UTC


## Get the bounds

convert.py allows to deal with timestamp and block conversion.  
The new "week" action gives all the required info from the Week Number and saves them to a week.json fi6e

Week 270  
`python3 convert.py --action=week --param=270`

```

week.json (week 10):
```
{
  "week": 10,
  "ts": 1541836800,
  "UTC": "2018-11-10T08:00:00Z",
  "last_pos_round": 1977,
  "pow_height": 901872,
  "balance": 8024
}
```
 
ts is the timestamp for the end of the weekly reward. It's always saturday 08:00 UTC.  
The next scripts take the values from this json.

## Fill_rounds

`python3 fill_rounds.py`  

Verifies again the registered and active HNs for each round of the period.   
This will tell if any HN cheated on its balance (balance dropped below the registered collateral)

## Fill_stats

`time python3 fill_stats.py`  

# Rewards extraction

`python3 calc_rewards.py`

Now does all the requests. Check SCORE_TRIGGER inside this script.  
Trigger was lowered from 0.2 (initial setting) to 0.1 (current setting, to account for more HNs), now temporary to 0.

```
